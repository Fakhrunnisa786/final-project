ersonal Portfolio Website – Fakhrunnisa Mohammadi
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a creative project built using only HTML and CSS to showcase who I am, what I’ve learned, and how I apply my skills and creativity in web development.

📌 About This Project
This portfolio was created as a final project for my web design course. It includes multiple pages to present:

🏠 Home Page – A warm welcome and quick introduction.

👩‍💻 About Me – A personal story and background.

📁 Projects – A list of beginner-friendly projects I’ve done or plan to build.

The goal of this project is to express my personal style and demonstrate my understanding of frontend design principles using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.
